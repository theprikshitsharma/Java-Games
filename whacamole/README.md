# Whack A Mole or...whacamole...get it? Guacamole?? The Dish?...

Fun little game, completed in like 2 hours. Made it Minecraft-themed cause why not. I haven't seen any bugs so far. I wrote an explanation for every line of code alongside it, so refer to it if you have any doubts.

## How to Play?

Click the chicken to earn 5 points. A special golden apple has a 1 in 50 chance of appearing and grants an additional 50 points (this chance can be configured in the game file). Clicking the TNT will end the game.
