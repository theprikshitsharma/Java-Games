# Java Games Repository

Hey there! Welcome to my stash of basic Java games. This repo is where I keep all the simple games I've cooked up in my spare time. It's cool to have them all in one place and see how much I've learned along the way.

## Why This Repo?
I spent a bunch of my free time coding these games. They might be simple, but each one was a fun challenge and a great way to practice my Java skills. From classics like Tic-Tac-Toe to some random ideas, there's a bit of everything here.

## What's Inside?
- **Whack A Mole:** Smash those moles fast! Stay sharp!
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** The classic game we all know and love.
- And more...

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/theprikshit/Java-Games.git`
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).
3. Run the App.java of the game you want to play.
